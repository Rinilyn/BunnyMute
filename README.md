# BunnyMute

Did you ever plug your bunny and think..What if the anti-virus detects my attack..
What if i was behind a box and can't see what im dealing with..
What if i was playing PUBG and the lobby was too loud and i was too lazy to press the keyboard mute button...
The scenarios are infinte! That is why it is my pleasure to introduce BunnyMute!
All you have to do is create a shortcut, put this as path:


%windir%\System32\SndVol.exe -f 49825268


Click Next button and call it "SndVol" (it's gona be named that by default) and click Finish.

Now You right click on it and select Properties.

Click Shortcut tab.

Assign your desired shortcut key like F8 or F9 in the Shortcut Key area. You need to assign it as F11 for the payload to work(you can change that)

Click OK/Apply and move the shortcut to the payload folder.
